# Coronavirus Stats Monitor

This was a simple tool I whipped up to run on my [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Raspberry Pi Cluster. 

It was purely an excercise to play with my local cluster and have a chance to explore Grafana / Prometheus for dashboards.

## Technologies

## Data Source

I used [Worldometer](http://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as a datasource. The data was only used privately for display on a private Grafana Dashboard.
